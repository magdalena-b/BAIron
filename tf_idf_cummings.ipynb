 nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals the power of your intense fragility:whose texture compels me with the color of its countries, rendering death and forever with each breathing  (i do not know what it is about you that closes and opens;only something in me understands the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses) nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands  my love thy hair is one kingdom   the king whereof is darkness thy forehead is a flight of flowers  thy head is a quick forest   filled with sleeping birds thy ******* are swarms of white bees   upon the bough of thy body thy body to me is april in whose armpits is the approach of spring  thy thighs are white horses yoked to a chariot   of kings they are the striking of a good minstrel between them is always a pleasant song  my love thy head is a casket   of the cool jewel of thy mind the hair of thy head is one warrior   innocent of defeat thy hair upon thy shoulders is an army   with victory and with trumpets  thy legs are the trees of dreaming whose fruit is the very eatage of forgetfulness  thy lips are satraps in scarlet   in whose kiss is the combinings of kings thy wrists are holy   which are the keepers of the keys of thy blood thy feet upon thy ankles are flowers in vases   of silver  in thy beauty is the dilemma of flutes    thy eyes are the betrayal of bells comprehended through incense  i have found what you are like the rain,              (who feathers frightened fields with the superior dust-of-sleep. wields  easily the pale club of the wind and swirled justly souls of flower strike  the air in utterable coolness  deeds of green thrilling light                                   with thinned  newfragile yellows                        lurch and.press  —in the woods                       which                               stutter                                         and                                                sing and the coolness of your smile is stirringofbirds between my arms;but i should rather than anything have(almost when hugeness will shut quietly)almost,                   your kiss  in the rain- darkness,     the sunset being sheathed i sit and think of you  the holy city which is your face your little cheeks the streets of smiles  your eyes half- thrush half-angel and your drowsy lips where float flowers of kiss  and there is the sweet shy pirouette your hair and then  your dancesong soul.     rarely-beloved a single star is uttered,and i  think        of you  if i believe in death be sure of this it is  because you have loved me, moon and sunset stars and flowers gold crescendo and silver muting  of seatides i trusted not,                     one night when in my fingers  drooped your shining body when my heart sang between your perfect *******  darkness and beauty of stars was on my mouth petals danced against my eyes and down  the singing reaches of my soul spoke the green-  greeting pale- departing irrevocable sea i knew thee death.                                and when i have offered up each fragrant night,when all my days shall have before a certain  face become white perfume only,           from the ashes then thou wilt rise and thou wilt come to her and brush  the mischief from her eyes and fold her mouth the new flower with  thy unimaginable wings,where dwells the breath of all persisting stars  it may not always be so; and i say that if your lips,which i have loved,should touch another’s,and your dear strong fingers clutch his heart,as mine in time not far away; if on another’s face your sweet hair lay in such silence as i know,or such great writhing words as,uttering overmuch, stand helplessly before the spirit at bay;  if this should be,i say if this should be— you of my heart,send me a little word; that i may go unto him,and take his hands, saying,accept all happiness from me. then shall i turn my face,and hear one bird sing terribly afar in the lost lands  who knows if the moon’s a baloon,coming out of a keen city in the sky—filled with pretty people? (and if you and i should  get into it,if they should take me and take you into their baloon, why then we’d go up higher with all the pretty people  than houses and steeples and clouds: go sailing away and away sailing into a keen city which nobody’s ever visited,where  always             it’s                    spring)and everyone’s in love and flowers pick themselves  as is the sea marvelous from god’s hands which sent her forth to sleep upon the world  and the earth withers the moon crumbles one by one stars flutter into dust  but the sea does not change and she goes forth out of hands and she returns into hands  and is with sleep….  love,     the breaking  of your         soul         upon my lips  let’s live suddenly without thinking  under honest trees,                         a stream does.the brain of cleverly-crinkling -water pursues the angry dream of the shore. by midnight,                                 a moon scratches the skin of the organised hills  an edged nothing begins to prune  let’s live like the light that kills and let’s as silence,                             because whirl’s after all: (after me)love,and after you. i occasionally feel vague how vague idon’t know tenuous now- spears and the then-arrows making do our mouths something red,something tall  nobody loses all the time  i had an uncle named sol who was a born failure and nearly everybody said he should have gone into vaudeville perhaps because my uncle sol could sing mccann he was a diver on xmas eve like hell itself which may or may not account for the fact that my uncle  sol indulged in that possibly most inexcusable of all to use a highfalootin phrase luxuries that is or to wit farming and be it needlessly added  my uncle sol’s farm failed because the chickens ate the vegetables so my uncle sol had a chicken farm till the skunks ate the chickens when  my uncle sol had a skunk farm but the skunks caught cold and died and so my uncle sol imitated the skunks in a subtle manner  or by drowning himself in the watertank but somebody who’d given my uncle sol a victor victrola and records while he lived presented to him upon the auspicious occasion of his decease a scruptious not to mention splendiferous funeral with tall boys in black gloves and flowers and everything and i remember we all cried like the missouri when my uncle sol’s coffin lurched because somebody pressed a button (and down went my uncle sol  and started a worm farm)  my love is building a building around you,a frail slippery house,a strong fragile house (beginning at the singular beginning  of your smile)a skilful uncouth prison, a precise clumsy prison(building thatandthis into thus, around the reckless magic of your mouth)  my love is building a magic, a discrete tower of magic and(as i guess)  when farmer death(whom fairies hate)shall  crumble the mouth-flower fleet he’ll not my tower,                         laborious, casual  where the surrounded smile                                 hangs                                            breathless  the      sky            was can    dy    lu minous             edible spry         pinks shy lemons greens    coo    1 choc olate s.    un    der,   a    lo co mo       tive        s  pout                                ing                                      vi                                      o                                      lets  it is at moments after i have dreamed of the rare entertainment of your eyes, when(being fool to fancy)i have deemed  with your peculiar mouth my heart made wise;

between the feet of awe), thunderer whose omnipotent brow showers its curls of unendured eternal gold over the infinite breast in bright degrees, whose pillow is the graces and the hours,  father of gods and men whose subtle throne twain sphinxes bear each with a writhing youth caught to her brazen *******,whose foot-stool tells how fought the looser of the warlike zone of her that brought forth

april:witchery of sound and odour drives the wingless thing man forth in the bright air,for now the red leaps in the maple’s cheek,and suddenly by shining hordes in sweet unserious dress ascends the golden crocus from the dead.  on dappled dawn forth rides the pungent sun with hooded day preening upon his hand followed by gay untimid final flowers (which dressed in various tremulous armor stun the eyes of ragged earth who sees them pass) while hunted from his kingdom winter cowers, seeing green armies steadily expand hearing the spear-song of the marching grass.  a silver sudden parody of snow tickles the air to golden tears,and hark! the flicker’s laughing yet,while on the hills the pines deepen to whispers primeval and throw backward their foreheads to the barbarous bright sky,and suddenly from the valley thrills the unimaginable upward lark and drowns the earth and passes into light  (slowly in life’s serene perpetual round a pale world gathers comfort to her soul, hope richly scattered by the abundant sun invades the new mosaic of the ground —let but the incurious curtaining dusk be drawn surpassing nets are sedulously spun to snare the brutal dew,—the authentic scroll of fairie hands and vanishing with the dawn).  spring,that omits no mention of desire in every curved and curling thing,yet holds continuous *******—through skies and trees the lilac’s smoke the poppy’s pompous fire the *****’s purple patience and the grave frailty of daises—by what rare unease revealed of teasingly transparent folds— with man’s poor soul superlatively brave.  surely from robes of particoloured peace with mouth flower-faint and undiscovered eyes and dim slow perfect body amorous (whiter than lilies which are born and cease for being whiter than this world)exhales the hovering high perfume curious of that one month for whom the whole years dies, risen at length from palpitating veils.  o still miraculous may!o shining girl of time untarnished!o small intimate gently primeval hands,frivolous feet divine!o singular and breathless pearl! o indefinable frail ultimate pose! o visible beatitude sweet sweet intolerable!silence immaculate of god’s evasive audible great

that clear candle whose expecting breath exults upon the tongue of flame half-mute, (haste ere some thrush with silver several tears complete the perfumed paraphrase of death).  now is the time when all occasional things close into silence,only one tree,one svelte translation of eternity unto the pale meaning of heaven clings, (whose million leaves in winsome indolence simmer upon thinking twilight momently) as down the oblivious west’s numerous dun magnificence conquers magnificence.  in heaven’s intolerable athanor inimitably tortured the base day utters at length her soft intrinsic hour, and from those tenuous fires which more and more sink and are lost the divine alchemist, the magus of creation,lifts a flower— whence is the world’s insufferable clay clothed with incognizable amethyst.  lady at whose imperishable smile the amazed doves flicker upon sunny wings as if in terror of eternity, (or seeming that they would mistrust a while the moving of beauteous dead mouths throughout that very proud transparent company of quivering ghosts-of-love which scarcely sings drifting in slow diaphanous faint rout),  queen in the inconceivable embrace of whose tremendous hair that blossom stands whereof is most desire,yet less than those twain perfect roses whose ambrosial grace, goddess,thy crippled thunder-forging groom or the loud lord of skipping maenads knows,— having discordia’s apple in thy hands, which the scared shepherd gave thee for his doom—  o thou within the chancel of whose charms the tall boy god of everlasting war received the shuddering sacrament of sleep, betwixt whose cool incorrigible arms impaled upon delicious mystery, with gaunt limbs reeking of the whispered deep, deliberate groping ocean fondled o’er the warm long flower of unchastity,  imperial cytherea,from frail foam sprung with irrevocable nakedness to strike the young world into smoking song— as the first star perfects the sensual dome of darkness,and the sweet strong final bird transcends the sight,o thou to whom belong th ehearts of lovers!—i beseech thee bless thy suppliant singer and his wandering word.  tumbling-hair               picker of buttercups

like to think that on the flower you gave me when we loved            the far- departed mouth sweetly-saluted lingers.             if one marvel  seeing the hunger of my lips for a dead thing, i shall instruct him silently with becoming  steps to seek your face     and i entreat,by certain foolish perfect hours           dead too, if that he come receive him as your lover sumptuously being  kind because i trust him to your grace,and for in his own land  he is called death.  all in green went my love riding on a great horse of gold into the silver dawn.  four lean hounds crouched low and smiling the merry deer ran before.  fleeter be they than dappled dreams the swift sweet deer the red rare deer.  horn at hip went my love riding riding the echo down into the silver dawn.  four lean hounds crouched low and smiling the level meadows ran before.  softer be they than slippered sleep the lean lithe deer the fleet flown deer.  four fleet does at a gold valley the famished arrows sang before.  bow at belt went my love riding riding the mountain down into the silver dawn.  four lean hounds crouched low and smiling the sheer peaks ran before.  paler be they than daunting death the sleek slim deer the tall tense deer.  four tall stags at a green mountain the lucky hunter sang before.  all in green went my love riding on a great horse of gold into the silver dawn.  four lean hounds crouched low and smiling my heart fell dead before.  when my love comes to see me it’s just a little like music,a little more like curving colour(say orange)           against silence,or darkness….  the coming of my love emits a wonderful smell in my mind,  you should see when i turn to find her how my least heart-beat becomes less. and then all her beauty is a vise  whose stilling

how between her hips india is.  whereas by dark really released,the modern flame of her indomitable body uses a careful fierceness.  her lips study my head gripping for a decision:burn the terrific fingers which grapple and joke on my passionate anatomy oh yes!  large legs pinch,toes choke— hair-thin strands of magic agony ….by day this lady in her limousine  oozes in fashionable traffic,just a halfsmile (for society’s sweet sake) in the not too frail lips almost discussed; between her and ourselves a nearly-opaque perfume disinterestedly obscene.  where’s madge then, madge and her men? buried with alice in her hair, (but if you ask the rain he’ll not tell where.)  beauty makes terms with time and his worms, when loveliness says sweetly yes to wind and cold; and how much earth is
