wind has blown the rain away
and the sun has just set
the trees stand
in the coolness of their little things
and the wind has just blown
cried a happy pink flower
and the leaves of
the happy pink flower are just
about to ****** all
and the leaf
of the leaf is just about to go
bigger and angrier than before
and the angrier the leaf is, the smaller and angrier
the tree

and the angrier the tree is, the smaller and angrier
the angrier the tree is, the smaller and angrier

the angrier the tree is, the smaller and angrier
